👋 Hello! I'm @Mr-Web3, a passionate enthusiast in the evolving world of web3 technology. My areas of interest include NextJS, React, TSX, Wagmi, Wallet Connect, IPFS, IPNS, Scaffold-ETH 2, as well as the broader realm of digital tokens and coins. 

🌱 Currently, I am deepening my knowledge in NextJS, Scaffold-ETH 2, and TSX, always eager to learn and grow in these fields.

💞️ Collaboration is something I am keenly looking forward to, especially in projects that push the boundaries of web3 technology. I am fascinated by the endless possibilities and am always ready to explore new frontiers in this domain.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me at contactcodebros@gmail.com for any exciting opportunities or discussions.

😄 On a personal note, I identify as a 'dude' and hold a deep respect for the diverse and unique identities we all bring to the table.

⚡ A fun fact about me: Aside from being a tech nerd with a love for all things digital, I come with 17 years of experience in the Telecom and Datacom industry. It's been a journey of continuous learning and adapting in this fast-paced tech world!
I use to program Camera Systems, Access Control, T-1's, PRI's, VOIP, KSU's, Servers, Alarm Systems, Point to Point Communications & much more!
